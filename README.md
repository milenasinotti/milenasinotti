## Hi, I'm Milena Sinotti 

I have a degree in Digital Design and a passion for creating innovative visual solutions that generate impact and tangible results. With 5 years of experience in the market, especially in the gaming and esports sectors, I am always looking for new trends and market demands.

Currently, I am diving into front-end development. My goal is to unify my design knowledge with programming to create memorable UI experiences. I believe that combining these skills allows for the development of projects that not only visually delight but also provide a seamless and intuitive user interaction.

Here you will find some of my projects, where I apply my design and programming knowledge to build engaging and functional interfaces.

Feel free to explore my repositories and follow my journey on GitHub!
